# Python

Welcome! These are my Python projects. 

**FoodHub Project**

Within the FoodHub project, the FoodHub company wants to analyze customer orders to pinpoint trends and recommendations that will lead to profitable decision-making.
This project includes exploratory data analysis on aspects such as order transactions, total orders, preparation times, and delivery times with univariate and 
bivariate data visualizations of relational variables. 

Data findings revealed a weak correlation between order costs, preparation times, and delivery times and 38% of orders without ratings. Recommendations include
ensuring that customers complete ratings for data validity, increasing meat-related menu items as they are the most frequently ordered by customers, and incentivizing 
customers to increase turnover through a rewards system or coupons.
